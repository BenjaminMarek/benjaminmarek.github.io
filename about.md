I’m Ben Marek, a student at Stanford studying Economics and Classics. I’m passionate about institutions and coherent, well-reasoned policy, striving to bridge ideas with real-world impact. My primary interests include economics, international relations, and defense. At Stanford, I have contributed to political science research and helped lead organizations like Stanford in Government to bring public service closer to campus.

When I'm not thinking about policy, I love reading ancient texts, playing quiz bowl, or cheering on Stanford football. Go Card!
